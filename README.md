# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
This is a command line application that implements a reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator. 
RPN, also known as postfix notation, is is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands.

Ex. '3+3' is written as '3 3 +'

If there are multiple operations, operators are given immediately after their second operands.

Ex. The expression written '3 − 4 + 5' is written as '3 4 − 5 +' 

4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.
